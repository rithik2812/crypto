Components of the Project:
Dash Web App:

Dash is a Python web framework for building interactive web applications.

The project uses Dash components like dcc.Graph, html.Div, and html.H1 to create the UI and display the cryptocurrency prices, historical data, and model predictions.

Fetching Cryptocurrency Data:

You use the CoinGecko API to fetch:

Top Cryptocurrencies: You get the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

Historical Data: For each cryptocurrency, historical price and volume data are fetched for a given time range (e.g., last 6 months).

This data is used to train the machine learning model and display on the dashboard.

Data Preprocessing:

The fetched data is cleaned and organized into a Pandas DataFrame.

It includes:

Date: The date for which the data is available.

Price: The closing price of the cryptocurrency.

Volume: The trading volume on that date.

Machine Learning Model:

XGBoost: The model uses XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) to predict cryptocurrency prices based on historical data. This model is trained using:

Features: Past prices and trading volumes.

Target: The future price prediction.

The model is trained on the historical data to capture patterns and trends in the prices of cryptocurrencies.

Prediction:

Once the model is trained, predictions can be made for future cryptocurrency prices. These predictions can be displayed on the Dash dashboard for the user to interact with.

Dashboard Interaction:

The Dash web app allows the user to:

View top cryptocurrencies: Display the list of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap.

Select a cryptocurrency: The user can select a specific cryptocurrency for which to view its historical data and predicted prices.

Graphical representation: The app can plot historical prices, trading volumes, and predicted future prices on interactive graphs using Plotly.

Predictive Graphs:

The predicted future prices can be displayed using Plotly (a graphing library) to show:

Time Series Plots: Visualizing historical data along with predicted data for easy comparison.

Prediction vs Actuals: Comparing the model's predictions to the actual historical data for accuracy assessment.










Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning method where multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) are combined to form a strong learner. The basic idea is to train a series of models, each of which corrects the errors (residuals) of its predecessor. The models are trained sequentially in such a way that each model focuses on the mistakes made by the previous models.

Key Steps in Gradient Boosting:
Start with a base model: The first model is trained on the original dataset (often a simple decision tree).
Calculate errors: The errors (residuals) of the base model are calculated, and the next model is trained to predict these residuals.
Iterate: New models are added in subsequent steps, where each new model tries to correct the mistakes of the ensemble.
